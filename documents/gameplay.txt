Story: The ants are actually processes in a computer. Narrator is task manager, who is surprised to see the ants.

Gameplay: Build anthills, which after one in-game day, conquer an area, preventing more entities from spawning. Safety radius from anthill increases until one day.

Make the game seem like a tower defense and the world is smaller than it actually is when in reality, it's much bigger. 

Maybe have an evolution tree and pheromones that buff ants.

RTS IDEA:

Basics: 
	Start with small base and a couple workers like in Starcraft.
	Have to find five pieces to fix teleporter to advance to next level.
	Difficulty increases as time passes, rewarding good macro.
	Can create workers to harvest more resources or soldiers to explore the map and defend the base.
	Monsters spawn randomly and attack soldiers and may wander into and attack base. 
	Items can be found throughout the map such as:
		Additional units
		Additional Structures
		Structure upgrades
		One-time temporary buffs to units

Extras:
	NPCs and various structures may have a chance to generate, allowing players to do things like fight a boss for rewards.
	Create map system like in Slay the Spire. Beating a level provides an upgrade to adjacent levels on the map, encouraging players to beat easier levels first before tackling a hard level. Beating a certain "boss" level on a map finishes the map and generates a new map.
	Different civilizations with different units.
